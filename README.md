## Ex1 - Shunting Yard Algorithm and Expressions

* Implementing the 
[Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm "Shunting Yard - wikipedia")

* Using Polymorphism, Inheritence and Operator Overloading to build a family of classes that constitute an algebraic expression

* Being able to create expressions with variables, unary and binary operators and calculate their result.

## Ex2 - Cache Management

* Implementing the LRU [cache replacement policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies) for a given student data structure.

* Allows us to save information in files, access the most recent structures in O(1) using a hashmap, while the old ones are withdrawn from the cache for space-complexity sake.

* Using Templates to extend our code reuse for any defined data structure.

* Memory management and constructor/deconstructor use to avoid possible leaks.
